; Here we:
; * Stop interrupts so we don't get interrupted.
; * Temporarily put the new EIP location in ECX.
; * Temporarily put the new page directory's physical address in EAX.
; * Set the base and stack pointers
; * Set the page directory
; * Put a dummy value (0x12345) in EAX so that above we can recognize that we've just
;   switched task.
; * Restart interrupts. The STI instruction has a delay - it doesn't take effect until after
;   the next instruction.
; * Jump to the location in ECX (remember we put the new EIP in there).
